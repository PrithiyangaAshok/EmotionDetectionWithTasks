# EmotionDetectionWithTasks
Emotion detection using Machine Learning with real time video capture and other deployments

IMPLEMENTED CODES OF TASKS
1.Compare the performance of time-series models with static image-based approaches for emotion recognition.

2.Dynamic model adaptation: Develop a system that adapts its emotion recognition model based on individual user data or real-time feedback, leading to personalized predictions.

3.Cultural and contextual awareness: Explore cultural variations in facial expressions and incorporate cultural context into the model to improve cross-cultural recognition accuracy.



4.Train separate models for each context or develop a multi-context model that adapts its predictions based on additional input data (e.g., location, cultural background).


5.Develop a real-time emotion detection system that operates on streaming video data and
identifies the predominant emotion in each frame."
